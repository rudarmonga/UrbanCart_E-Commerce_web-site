Added validations to maintain data integrity.
Integrated bcrypt for secure password hashing.
âœ… User Controller Development
Implemented controller functions to:
Create new users
Retrieve user details
Update user information
Delete users when necessary
Handled error responses for invalid or duplicate user entries.
âœ… Multer File Upload Integration
Configured Multer to manage file uploads (e.g., profile pictures).
Implemented logic to store and retrieve uploaded images.
Ensured file validation to prevent the upload of unsupported file types.
âœ… Project Submission
